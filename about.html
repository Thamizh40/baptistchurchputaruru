                        <h2>Our Story</h2>
                        <p>Grace Community Church has been a beacon of faith and hope in our community for over 25 years. Founded with a vision to create a welcoming space for all people to encounter God's love, we have grown into a diverse and vibrant congregation.</p>
                        <p>Our journey began with a small group of believers who were passionate about making a difference. Today, we continue that mission with the same dedication and love that inspired our founding members.</p>

                        <p>We believe that every person has inherent value and a unique purpose. Our goal is to help individuals find their place in God's story and live out their calling with passion and purpose.</p>
